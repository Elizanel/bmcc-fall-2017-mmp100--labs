  <h1> My Favorite Artist:</h1>
    <h2>Adele</h2>

    <h3>About Adele</h3>
    <p>   Adele is a singer-song writer born on May 5, 1988 in the United Kingdom. She performs a handful of pop music but her specialty in my opnon are soulful balads. Her most downloaded song on itunes would be Rolling in the Deep, which was realesed in 2010. Adele is one of my favorite artiat becuase her voice is absolutly beautiful. Her voice in my opnion is raw and hearing her sing live is no diffrent from hearing her songs on itunes or spodify. She is also my favorite artist because her songs are mainly ballads and I find ballads quite calming. Adele's songs also dont hold morbid or childish meanings to them, each song comes from a pass experience and i think that adds to her talent and love towards music. </p></div>
